# Streaming Test Instructions

## Test Pages Created

1. **`/debug`** - Browser-based streaming test with visual output
2. **`/api/simple-stream`** - Raw streaming API endpoint

## Testing Streaming

### Browser Test
Visit `/debug` and click "Test Streaming". You should see chunks appear one by one.

### Command Line Test
```bash
curl -N https://your-app.vercel.app/api/simple-stream
```

### Expected vs Actual Behavior

**If streaming works correctly:**
- Chunks appear progressively with 1-second delays
- curl shows output line by line as it arrives

**If buffered (common issue):**
- All content appears at once after 5+ seconds
- curl shows no output until stream completes

## Platform-Specific Issues

### Vercel
- May buffer responses for performance
- Try adding `X-Accel-Buffering: no` header (added in simple-stream route)

### Railway
- Usually supports streaming but may have buffering in some regions

### Netlify
- Static hosting - streaming support limited
- Functions may work but often buffered

## Debugging Steps

1. Test locally first (`npm run dev`)
2. Test with curl on deployed version
3. Check browser dev tools Network tab for transfer encoding
4. Look for "Transfer-Encoding: chunked" in response headers

## Alternative Approaches

If true streaming doesn't work on your platform:
1. Use client-side progressive loading with `useEffect`
2. Implement polling-based updates
3. Use WebSockets for real-time updates
